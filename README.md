# CogniDhi — AI-powered Cognitive Screening & Brain-Fitness

**Short description**  
CogniDhi is a multimodal AI cognitive-health companion: clinically-grounded cognitive screening, longitudinal tracking, and personalized brain-fitness routines with gamified engagement. This repo contains the prototype code, documentation, and pitch deck for the project. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Key features
- Digital test battery: 12+ validated tasks (memory, attention, executive function, language, visuospatial, emotion recognition).  
- Multimodal AI: speech transcription & emotion analysis, embeddings for longitudinal tracking, generative visual stimuli, and GPT-based coaching.  
- Age-aware risk flagging (children → seniors) and clinician exportable reports.  
- Gamified daily plans, badges, and family/peer challenges to boost adherence.

## Tech stack
- Frontend: React Native (mobile-first)  
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Vector DB (Pinecone / Milvus)  
- AI: OpenAI (Whisper, GPT, embeddings, DALL·E), custom inference pipelines (PyTorch)  
- DevOps: Docker, Google Cloud Platform  
- Privacy: HIPAA/GDPR-ready design (anonymization, opt-in consent)

Application Coming Soon...
