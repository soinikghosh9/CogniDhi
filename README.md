- Multimodal AI: speech transcription & emotion analysis, embeddings for longitudinal tracking, generative visual stimuli, and GPT-based coaching.  
- Age-aware risk flagging (children → seniors) and clinician exportable reports.  
- Gamified daily plans, badges, and family/peer challenges to boost adherence.

## Tech stack
- Frontend: React Native (mobile-first)  
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Vector DB (Pinecone / Milvus)  
- AI: OpenAI (Whisper, GPT, embeddings, DALL·E), custom inference pipelines (PyTorch)  
- DevOps: Docker, Google Cloud Platform  
- Privacy: HIPAA/GDPR-ready design (anonymization, opt-in consent)
